(this is not complete -- just a summary xd)

* tweaked program to allow for spell check with upper and lower case words
* developed a candidate model
  (spellr.ai can now suggest possible words to rectify a spelling error)
    * also started preliminary work on a recursive candidate model 
      (suggesting possible words given a set of possible words, etc)
* implement checks to ensure that the set of suggested words is restricted to only words found in the data sets (i.e., english words)
* added some basic unit tests and regression tests
